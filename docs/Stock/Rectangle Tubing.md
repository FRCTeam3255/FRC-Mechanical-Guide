## Overview

- Square tubing is used to make up structural parts of the robot, like the frame, and other structures
- Tubing is normally held together by brackets made from sheet metal
- Square Tubing that is used in FRC is typically 6061 Aluminum

**See table of contents for a breakdown of this section.**

## Info

- Rectangle tubing is measured and sold by **Width**, **Height**, **Wall Thickness**, and **Stock Length**
    - **Width** and **Height**, can create a square, or a rectangle, and sizes vary based on the different use of the tubing
        - **Height** and **Length** are commonly 2" x 1", 1.5" x 1.5", 1" x 1"
        - 2" x 1" tubing is commonly used as the drivetrain frame on most robots
    - **Wall Thicknesses** are separate from **Width** and **Height**, should be thicker, when more structural support is needed
        - Wall thicknesses are most commonly 1/8" and 1/16"
        - Tubing that bearings are mounted in are typically 1/8"
        - Thicker tubing quicky adds weight to the robot, so it is important to use thinner tubing when you can, or lightweight it
    - **Stock Length**, pertains to how long each tube is, it is normally to buy long extrusions and then cut pieces to the lengths you need
        - Tubing is normally sold in bulk lengths of 6', 3', and 1' online
- Tubing is also commonly used as a slider, for elevator subsystems

## Tubing fabrication

- Tubing is typically cut to length by **Horizontal Bandsaws**, or **Chopsaws** 
- Lightweighting is normally done on a CNC Mill, CNC Router, or drilled out by hand
