## Overview

- Sheet metal, is a large sheet of metal, that is typically cut into smaller pieces, or intricate shapes to be used
- Most sheet metal used in FRC is aluminum because it is, light, easy to cut, and strong (We buy 6061 Aluminum)
- Sheet metal is measured and sold by **Length**, **Width**, and, **Thickness**

**See table of contents for a breakdown of this section.**

***

### Size

- The **Length** and **Width** of sheet metal you buy should be based on how you will cut it out
    - If you have a router, it is normally the most cost effective to buy the largest sheet that will fit on it
- The thickness of the sheet metal varies based on what its use is on the robot
- Some common thickness include
    - **1/16th"** (0.0625") Which is not structural, and can be easily bent, however bending can also to form different parts as well
    - **1/8"** (0.125") Which can be used for low stress structual parts, and can also be used to bend into different parts
    - **3/16"** (0.1875") Which is structual and can be used for many applications, but does not bend very easily
    - **1/4"** (0.25") Which is very structual, and is typically used on parts of the robot that must remain very rigid, they are commonly used as gearbox plates because standard **FRC hex bearings** are .25" thick so they mount flush

!!! Warning
    The thicker the sheet metal, the heavier it is
We most commonly uses 1/4", and 1/8" sheet metal

### Fabricating sheet metal

- Sheet metal is very versatile and can be cut, or bent to create many uses
  
#### Cutting sheet metal

##### CNC

- Sheet metal is typically cut with a CNC, cutters like **Routers**, **Mills**, **Water Jets**, or **Laser Cutters** (We like amny other FRC teams use a **Velox CNC router**)
- Sheet metal is cut on CNC cutters, by creating a toolpath using CAD files for the machine to trace and give yu your parts
- CNCs can also cut out pockets, or holes in the center of your parts as well
- The thicker the sheet metal, the more difficult it is to cut, it is important to know the limits of your machine
  
##### Saws

- If you or your team does not own a CNC Cutter, you can cut parts out, without CAD, by hand using different kinds of saws, but it will not be accurate like the machines cut
- Sheet metal is commonly cut out by **Horizontal Bandsaws**, **Jigsaws**, and **Circular Saws**
- These saws can cut out th edges of the part, but you will need to mark out and drill by hand andy openings on the inside edge

#### Bending sheet metal

Thinner sheet metal, like 1/16" and 1/8" can be easily bent into different shapes that can be helpful to create certain parts 

- You can bend sheet metal, with a hand operated **Metal Brake**, or you can bend it with a **CNC Break press**, if your team has one
- Sheet metal you wish to bend, is normally a different type of Aluminum the 6061, because it is brittle and may crack if bent too far (On 3255 we bend 3003 aluminium)
