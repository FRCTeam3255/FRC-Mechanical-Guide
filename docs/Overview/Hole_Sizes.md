Typically hole sizes are defined by diameter, which is the full across dimension of a circle

## Hole types

There are multiple kinds of holes that are often used.

!!! Info "Through holes"
    Designed for something to fit through it like a bolt, rivet, or bearing

!!! Info "Threaded holes"
    Designed for threads for a screw or bolt to be added into

Holes are typically made by drills or mills

Some common drill bit sizes we use are:

- 3/16in (0.1875)
- 1/4in (0.25)
- 3/8in (0.375)

These holes get their diameters from what their job is.

!!! Example
    A hex bearing has a 1.125 Od (Outer diameter) so the hole for it would be 1.125
