# Robot Requirements

Every FRC robot has to meet certain requirements, regarding safety and some other regulations to be eligible to compete in competition.

## Overview

- You will receive the robot requirements for the each seasonâ€™s game in the manual that you get on kickoff. This manual descibes what the robot will do as well as the constraints it must operate under
- The manual also shows the field and the different elements, or gamepieces the robots will interact with

**See table of contents for a breakdown of this section.**

## Robot Size / Requirements

- Each year the FRC game manual will tell you the max frame perimeter and weight your robot can have.
- The frame perimeter is measured in length width and height, and the constraints are met if your robot can fit in a "box" of the given dimensions (This is your starting configuration)
    - Ex: In 2018 the frame perimeter was 33" x 28" x 55" tall 
- The manual also typically gives you a max length that you are allowed to extend outside your frame perimeter, as long as it can be stored, within the frame at the start of a match
- Robots are required to be inspected at each competition before competing in any matches
    - Inspections look at the size, weight, safety, price, and bumpers of the robot
    - Robots cannot have sharp edges, or dangerous components that can harm other robots
- Every robot is required to wear a set of pool noodle bumpers, that mount to it's outermost frame
    - Extending past your bumpers is risky because components outside the bumpers are not as well protected
- Robots can only be constructed with components that are not outlawed in the game manual 
    - Ex: Robots cannot use hydraulic pistons because they are marked as illegal in the game manual

## General Robot Design

- After reading through the game manual, teams then decide which tasks from it, they plan to have their robot complete
- After deciding these teams typically break their robots into subysystems, or different task completers, that make up their whole robot
  
Some common subsystems used in most games include

- **Drivetrains** (To give the ability to drive around)
- **Intakes** (To collect a field element)
