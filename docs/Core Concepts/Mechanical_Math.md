## Standards

It is important to always use standardized measurements for everything we do so every part is easy to make and repeat.

We typically work with measurements that are [**Imperial** (Inches)](#imperial), but sometimes we will have to work with parts that are in the **Metric** system (Millimeters).

Inches are indicated with a (") after a number and feet are indicated with a (').  
Ex: 1.5" this measurement is 1.5 inches  
Ex: 1'3" this measurment is 1 foot, 3 inches

<!-- TODO: Add links to measuring tools -->

There is a wide range of measuring tools such as: [Rulers](../Tools/Measuring%20Tools.md#rulers), [Tape Measures](../Tools/Measuring%20Tools.md#tape-measures), Calipers, and Micrometers

!!! warning
    It is important to use an **imperial tool when working on a imperial part** and a **metric tool when working on a metric part**.

### Imperial

Many imperial measurements are based on **fractions of inches**, or **thousandths of inches**.

**Fractions**  
Fractional measurements are typically based on **1/16ths**, **1/8ths**, **1/4ths**, or **1/2nds** increments of whole inches. 

Some of the most common fraction imperial measurements we use are:

- **1/16"** (0.0625")
- **1/8"** (0.125")
- **3/16"** (0.1875")
- **1/4"** (0.25")
- **1/2"** (0.5")
- **3/4"** (0.75")
- **1"**

!!! Tip
    Memorizing these decimal values will be very helpful.

Some more precise measurements are: 

- **3/8"** (0.375")
- **5/8"** (0.675")
- **7/8"** (0.875")

**Thousandths**  
Thousandths measurements are based off of how many thousandths of an inch a measurement is. 

Thousandths examples:

- **1"** (1000 thousandths of an inch (1 inch))
- **.1"** (100 thousandths of an inch)
- **.01"** (10 thousandths of an inch)
- **.001"** (1 thousandth of an inch)  

!!! Tip
    We typically only measure to the 10 thousandths place on even our most precise parts.
